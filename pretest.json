      "question": "1. What is the ground state energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "E₀ = 0",

        "d": "E₀ = 2ℏω"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct! Unlike classical mechanics, the quantum harmonic oscillator has a minimum energy of ½ℏω, called zero-point energy. The particle can never be completely at rest."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct! For a normalized wavefunction, ∫|ψ(x)|²dx = 1, which means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space is 1. For discrete states, this becomes Σ|cₙ|² = 1."

    {
      "question": "10. Why can't a quantum harmonic oscillator have zero energy?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because of energy conservation",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle (ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2) prevents both position and momentum from being exactly zero simultaneously. This results in a minimum zero-point energy of ½ℏω."
