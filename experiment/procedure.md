### Procedure
Step 1: Change the clock ticks to change curve so the curve changes

Step 2: Study the graph
Step 3: Control speed and study graph 
Step 4: finish with the experiment
Step 5: Note down the amplitude of each state (n =9 : no of states) keeping magnitude same see how the phase is changing for each state .
Step 6: Fill in the table 
| No OF state (n) | Magnitude |
|-----------------|-----------|
| 1               |           |
| 2               |           |
| 3               |           |
| 4               |           |
| 5               |           |
| 6               |           |
| 7               |           |
